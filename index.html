            <h4>Our Journey</h4>
            <p>Nine years ago, my family and I moved to Detroit with the hope of living and ministering in what was at the time one of the poorest zip codes in the city. Serving closely, with good friends and fellow pastors, we planted Mack Avenue Community Church (MACC). Friends and family seriously questioned my decision to move my very pregnant wife to what many labeled “the most dangerous city in America.” Although built for over 2 million people, Detroit’s population had decreased by over two-thirds. The high school drop out rate was greater than 35% and the equally debilitating unemployment rate was hovering around 20%. Our time here has shown us that while there is a great need for evangelism and discipleship, there were also those life-long residents who, with a vibrant faith, had weathered the years of ever increasing poverty, political corruption, tax foreclosures and minimal city services, doing their best to be a light in their community. We are blessed to join with these saints trusting God for healthier communities where quality education, clean and safe neighborhoods, and economic stability increases the quality of life. However, external remedies will only go so far without the gospel of Jesus Christ changing the hearts of individuals.</p>
            <p> Would you help us pursue holistic revitalization, where people get to experience the beauty of the gospel while being reminded of their value, dignity and worth? Help us pursue this reality by pledging to give $150, $100, or $50 a month. </p>
            <p> Four children later, my wife and I are thankful that Lord guided us here to live out the gospel in community. In the midst of many unjust and broken systems, we see that God is very present and we delight that we get to participate in His kingdom purposes, reminding others that there is a loving God who, not only created them, but intimately knows them and wants an eternal relationship with them.</p>
            <p>Jesus Christ’s redemptive work on the cross places the Vice President of Ford on the same level as the homeless mother of three, because all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God and all are in need of His salvation.</p>
            <p> Your financial support allows me to give the majority of my day towards kingdom work here in Detroit.</p>
            <br>
            <div id="goal"></div>
            <h4>God’s Provision</h4>
            <p>I am grateful that as a pastor and missionary in Detroit, I have been able to give the best hours of my day to advancing the gospel and maturing believers. In order for me to continue serving in this capacity, I am asking for your partnership to help meet the needs of my family and the community through your prayers and financial support. We have many faithful supporters that have partnered with us throughout the years. For a number of reasons some of those supporters have needed to stop giving. We are blessed to be a part of this extended community of faith and we are excited to embrace others who desire to join us in our work here. </p>
