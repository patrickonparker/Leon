            <h4>Our Journey</h4>
            <p>I, Leon Stevenson, moved my family to Detroit, Michigan six years ago. Friends and family seriously questioned my decision to move my very pregnant wife to what many label the the most dangerous city in America.” This city was built for over 2 million but has been abandoned by over two-thirds of its citizens, has a high school drop out rate greater near 35% and an equally debilitating unemployment rate hovering around 20%. Sadly over 43% of people in Detroit are living below the poverty line. Considering these statistics, it is not surprising that many feel abandoned and devalued in the city. It was the Lord revealing this brokenness that inspired our team to start a church in the heart of Detroit.</p>
            <p>Now, six years and four children later, my wife and I are excited to be a part of the body of Christ seeking to advance God’s kingdom in Detroit. God loves the people who live here simply because they are created in His image, and as the people of God, we are able to remind those who feel hopeless of their value in the Lord. Nothing but the gospel of Jesus Christ can restore a person’s dignity and worth! His story, redeems all of humanity, and it places the Vice President of Ford on the same level as the homeless mother of three, because all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God and all are in need of His salvation.</p>

            <h4>God’s Accomplishments</h4>
            <p>It is with great joy that I have had the pleasure of seeing God transform Detroit through renewing the hearts of families. I am blessed to serve with one of my closest friends as a pastor at Mack Avenue Community Church (MACC).</p>

                <li class="collection-item">The model of discipleship taught by our Lord Jesus is the hallmark of our ministry. Some are being led to Jesus through the ministry at Mack Ave., while others are learning how to live for Him. More than 60 (and growing) members are now in discipleship relationships, learning how to walk by faith, share their faith, and multiply their faith by pouring into the lives of others. </li>
                <li class="collection-item">Families are meeting in homes weekly to grow in their understanding of the scriptures and are serving together in efforts to bring physical renewal to the community.</li>
                <li class="collection-item">Locals and transplants are growing in Christ together. Over 30 families have moved from Michigan suburbs and other parts of the country to serve with our MACC family.</li>
                <li class="collection-item">We created a Christ centered non-profit that operates a sports, literacy, and housing programs. More recently, we started a legal clinic.</li>

            <p>I am grateful that as a pastor and missionary in Detroit, I have been able to give the best hours of my day to advancing the gospel and maturing believers. In order for me to continue serving in this capacity, I am asking for your partnership to help meet the needs of my family and the community through your prayers and financial support.</p>
